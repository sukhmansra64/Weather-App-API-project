# Weather-App-API-project
This weather app uses the open weather maps api to give a live forecast of any city from a large list. The app itself is made on HTML and styled using CSS, the api fetches are done using Javascript.
The app also hosts a local server using a combination of nodeJS and expressJS to allow the use of JSON files in the html file for use with the autofill searchbar
Lastly an ip locator API is used to help identify the current location and then display the forecast.
Next steps for this project would be to implement the use of react and bootstap to simplify the code and allow for better effectiveness.
